Edge wrap seems more of a gimick than a useful feature,carrie karchin,"December 9, 2021",3.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"I bought this moto edge to replace my moto x4.  The curved screen seemed more of a gimick than a useful product.  When you put on  a cell phone  cover of most any type, the edge features are covered and become useless. Only a few covers allow the edge functions to work . But I didn't have those types so I can't say for well they  allow edge functions to work.  Reading text that curves around the side is not useful, especially with a case even if you turn off the edge function.  The Edge does provide a large screen with the same useful area as slighly larger phones because there are not  corner rims. The finger print sensor works great.  I don't like the swipe options to go to previous screen. I would prefer a home button similar to older moto phones than swiping up to reach home.  At $399 this phone is a good value, especially if you like the edge functions.  I am just not happy with it compared to my other moto phones"
No good,Ashley,"December 6, 2021",1.0,Style: RAZR 5GColor: Liquid Mercury,Verified Purchase,No good
Nice but edges are sometimes a problem,Rosalind,"December 4, 2021",4.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"I like the phone, but the rounded side edges can be a problem sometimes. Sometimes it's hard to read stuff that's right on the edge of the screen, and it's very hard to find a case that will protect it without disabling the touch screen properties at the edges."
I still haven't gotten the correct case,Amazon Customer,"December 4, 2021",4.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,Am still having a little challenge.. can't find the right fit case for this phone.. the one am using.don't have a entrance for the head phone..Am going to make a decision on it.. read the text.. THE CASE DON'T HAVE THE ACCESS FOR THE HEAD PHONE..
Fantastic...Thing...,Worldreviewed,"December 2, 2021",5.0,,,"All, I had purchased this phone form T-Mobile as an upgrade and here is my unbiased review. For clarification purposes, I do understand its limitations and how it fares against other Android power devices, foldable or not and equally against the IOS, since I am also using and have been using Iphones for years. The reason why I am giving it 5 * is mostly because of the overall attempt of a company, no matter the name, to go out and do something different, in a word of almost ""all phone looking identical"". There were times in not so distant past when companies actually were taking risks and create unique memorable devices. Now, everyone is following everyone else, focusing on how not to fail, rather than how to differentiate from the crowds. I will address all the negative and positive reviews and provide feedback hoping some big shot Motorola/Lenovo executive is listening.First, I purchased this phone due a strong emotional connection I have always had with Motorola as a brand; regardless who owns the brand now and where the company comes from, let's face it, we are communicating today the way we do, because of companies like Motorola. It's important that Motorola as a name continues to thrive. I have never owned the original Razr, but I had purchased the original form my brother at his 18th birthday anniversary. At that time I was using a SonyEricsson T68i ( whoever remembers that) and I was coming from a Motorola V70 ( for the younger readers, that was the most beautiful phone I have ever seen).Price:There is no way that this phone is worth the initial $1,300, nor the heavily discounted $800 price. Not by today's standard, nor by any standard, regardless its uniqueness, emotional connection or any other criteria. $600 is the right price and anything below that is a bargain. You will need to consider its form factor and basically the lack of competition. Don't tell me it's ""crap"". How much crap we all have purchased and paid the extra $$$ just because it allowed us to identify with some elite crowds. So, once again, $600 is super fair.Functionality:I just love the form factor. Besides that, it has anything and everything a modern phone can and should do for $600. What it also does that nothing else does it, or does it better is the looks. It's just beautiful!!! I won't go into other details, since everything is just subjective. Sure, you'll read "" it has only one speaker, camera is not the best, can't open with one hand"". All valid points, but it also, by no means, sucks at any of that. Speaker is loud enough, you don't need two speakers. Camera is great, sure not Iphone quality. I can open it with one hand, sure, it could have been easier. Once again, you will have to look at where the market stands, to understand how advanced actually this phone is.Here are some opportunities for improvement ( not that any of these are a deal breaker, but there's room for improvement without much effort, in my opinion).Weight: it's heavy, very heavy. I know everyone is after the ""premium feel"" but there were times when you could create the premium with ""good ol' plastic"" or fancier called ""Reinforced Polymer"". I , for one, don't care if my phone is made of metal, glass and what not. The purpose of a device you have on you every day is to make your life easier. Make the next generation out of plastic, if you can shave 50-100 grams. at almost 200 grams, it's heavy and it doesn't have to be that way to be beautiful and functional. As a plus, I guarantee you, the next two concerns will be eliminated.Signal Reception: I am sure we have read some reviews about not so stelar wifi/network reception and sadly, it's true. It's not terrible, but it isn't among the best either. I bet if the phone was more made of plastic, reception would have been a lot better.Vibration Motor: this is really bugging me. I remember the old time motorola pagers vibrating your pants and scaring me every time I got a notification. I am sure this is a combination between the choice of vibrator motor ( which is mostly a cheap, tiny one) and ....the inability to transmit the vibration through the massive 200 grams of metal and glass. There is reason why smart watches are plastic made in the back: vibration can be felt, signal can get through). The vibration motor is terrible and this is the only negative thing I have to say about the phone. I can live with it, but it's somehow unacceptable. I miss every call if I keep the phone on vibrating only.Processing power: It's fine for all the tasks. Sure is. Also, sure, it gets hot with extended use, but bearable. Playing games, intensive games like Call Of Duty is a no go. Phone gets hot to the point of becoming unusable. I don't care for that, as I do not play games too much, but this is also an Android problem so not this phone flaw. Applications, in general, don't run that smooth on Android as they do on IOS. Sure thing, if you have never actually used an Iphone before, you will disagree with me, but that's besides the point I am trying to make.Overall Build Quality: It's great, but did I mention how heavy it is? All the glass around, it's an accident waiting to happen. No wonder I see many people out there with a cracked display. I went ahead and got a case and, the best of all, purchased Accident Protection from Motorola directly. Sure, I could have gotten one from someone else, probably for less, but then again, I want Motorola to thrive and did my part sustaining a brand I grew up with and I believe it. It's all emotional but so it is the very same reason why if  you remember the original Razr, you should go right ahead and buy this thing. Until next time, I got to flip, speaking of which, like to other!"
Great phone at a reduced price.,Jacob Flores,"December 1, 2021",5.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,I like this phone so much I had to buy another one because I broke the screen on the first one and it would cost more than half the price to repair so I figured I'd just buy a new one and I cut it at a cheaper price... I really love it the screen works really good and it holds up to one terabyte of space I like that
Expensive parts then iphone. Is not worthy money,Amazon Customer,"November 27, 2021",3.0,,,Not enough good money worthy. Parts very expensive and rare. Lcd and glass touch screen $199  Amazon. Think twice B4 buy. Not good protection.
Don't buy,pdz183,"November 27, 2021",1.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,This is the worst phone I've ever owned. Not even a week having it. The edge sensitivity is terrible trying to type or scroll the palm of my hand is near the edge so I can't do anything unless you lay the phone down and use 1 finger. I will be asking for a full refund.
"An old favorite, now better than ever",David Wells,"November 24, 2021",5.0,Style: RAZR 5GColor: Liquid Mercury,Verified Purchase,"I've only had this phone for a day, and I love it already.  I had some trepidation about switching from iOS to Android, but it's been really easy.  I did have to download all my apps from Google's Play Store, but my contacts and music transferred over easily.  My case is probably easier as I tended to use Outlook for emails, calendar, contacts etc, so I lost nothing once I downloaded it to this phone.Pro's:- Folding smart-phone fits in my jeans pocket!  I was really getting tired of how huge the new phones are.  Maybe some people want to watch movies or play games on their cell phone, but not me!- Super-slick design (Apple has nothing on Moto here)- Every app I used on iPhone is available, and quickly loaded onto my new Android phone.- Front screen is highly functional - I've already learned to do many thing without opening the flip.- Main screen is beautiful.  I hope it remains so!- I always loved my old RAZR, and this is definitely triggering some nostalgic memories.- Dual SIM & globally unlocked means when I move to Italy next month this same phone will serve both my US and Italian numbers simultaneously.- Not sold in Italy apparently, so my Italian friends are gonna be jealous!Con's:- Switching OS's is a bit of a nuisance.  Truth is, if Apple offered a folding iPhone I probably would've bought that.  BUT they don't, so hello Moto!- No wireless charging.  I guess Motorola will fix this eventually.- USB-C connector means all my old charging/syncing cords are useless.  Oh well, cables are cheap so it's worth it."
Carness,Moussa Mehdi,"November 22, 2021",5.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"The best ever. , right place right time"
Just what I was looking for.,Mark C. James,"November 22, 2021",5.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"I went to Spectrum when a salesperson called my and informed me that they used the Verizon back-bone. I was on a Sprint back-bone for so long. Just started my job, so I bought the cheapest phone they had. An LG-LK31. After about a year, that phone was S O  S L O W! So I upgraded. It was between the Samsung S21 and this. This phone was 1/2 the price and is fast. Very happy with it so far."
nice phone,Omar rivas,"November 21, 2021",5.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,screen might be too sensitive sometimes
Don’t spend money on it.,Md Tanvir Ahmed,"November 20, 2021",2.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,You’ll find lots of better phones for this price. Returned it.
Just what I wanted and expected.,Stephen Vincent,"November 20, 2021",5.0,Style: RAZR 5GColor: Polished Graphite,Verified Purchase,External display is very sensitive to vibration or movement and will display time for a few seconds. Haven't figured a way too lower this or turn it off.
Nice and awesome.,Cam,"November 19, 2021",5.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"This Moto Edge is totally nice and awes. ""buy it"" You will be happy. The UI is awesome. Mine was updated to Android 11 during normal mot updates. Happy with my new phone."
Expensive at half the price.,Eric Foss,"November 19, 2021",1.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"This phone has become a pain in the ---. If you look at it wrong it starts up, if anything touches the screen anywhere it starts. Most annoying is it won't connect to any of my desktop computers so I have to take the SD card out to copy music or other data to it. The side screen feature gets in the way far too easily as well. Looks nice but is a pain."
Happy meal toy,ray seaman,"November 10, 2021",1.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,I don't understand how they can charge money for this the Bluetooth randomly disconnects sometimes in the middle of something I'm listening/watching and the customer service Is basically non existent. You may as well give it away in a happy meal
Disappointed for a flagship phone.,J. Canterbury,"November 5, 2021",1.0,,,"The edge display just gets in the way especially if you use apps that have buttons in that area and makes it difficult to use. About 3 months in the rear camera immediately looses focus so I have to put it on ultrawide to take a rear picture. My data keeps dropping and found out that it was an issue with the phone and not service. Also had a weird issue with bluetooth where the phone will connect to a bluetooth device but plays through the phone. Restarting fixes this issue but its an issue nonetheless. 11 months in my phone ""charges slowly"" even with the turbo charger. I'm super disappointed in this device and I probably won't buy another motorola.  This was supposed to be a gift for my wife last year but I got her an iphone instead. I'm glad I did because I would have heard about it until I bought her a new phone."
Muy buen teléfono,José A,"November 5, 2021",5.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,Estoy súper con mi nuevo teléfono
great phone,amy collupy,"November 4, 2021",5.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,works great so far easy to move information
Features Missing Because I Was Sold a 2020 Model,Phillip Randall,"November 3, 2021",1.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,Phone looks great at first until you try to connect it by USB c cable to a PC. Having a data usage problem with my Wi-fi I thought I would connect my Mororola Edge to my PC by just pluging in a data enabled USB c cable and letting Windows 10 install drivers. Motorola Edge requires special apps on both the PC and the phone. After hours with a less than knowledgeable customer service representative the PC part is installed. The phone app will not install so far. I am not looking forward to hours on the phone with a ignorant customer service rep tomorrow. Turns out after several calls to motorola customer service the 2020 model I was sold will not ever  use the larger screen on my laptop. Sorry I bought this obsolete phone in 2021. Caveat Emptor - Let the  buyer beware.
Don't buy it!,Brian,"October 27, 2021",1.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"My phone crapped out today. I purchased it in April 2021.After dealing with Motorola customer service, who clearly didn't understand that I couldn't go through the normal troubleshooting steps because my phone's screen literally no longer works, they advised that it'll take more than two weeks to send a replacement. They made the switch back to Samsung so much easier"
Great,viper,"October 24, 2021",5.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,So far im happy with it
Screen Not Working After 1 Year,George V,"October 22, 2021",2.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"The phone is overall ok - ok camera, battery life, and so on. But the screen has been giving me a lot of issues. I currently have a screen that is not physically damaged (no cracks), but the screen appears to be leaking from the inside (black blotch on the bottom left), the left side does not respond to touch, and the rest of the screen needs to be touched repeatedly to do anything.Not very happy with a $500 phone not working great after a year, so I would not buy again. Contacting Motorola to see if I can replace the phone, but the 12 month insurance ended a few month ago (sigh). We bought the Samsung S20 FE 5G for my wife once it came out, and her phone is better. Hope that helps!"
Does not allow calls over internet,Chuck,"October 21, 2021",2.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,Will not hook up calls on internet
Perfect daily phone,Lenny Nero,"September 29, 2021",5.0,Style: RAZR 5GColor: Blush Gold,Verified Purchase,"It's the phone I was waiting for ever since feature-phone foldables and original Razr.Sure it squeaks when opening, doesn't have active dual sim support (there is an eSim option besides a physical sim), there's no wireless charging, or top processor and 24 cameras on it... BUT, I rarely use the camera, only for photographing something in a store for a later purchase, things like that, and the simple fact of foldability, makes it s9 compact it fits into a front shirt pocket - very useful during the summer. Outer screen is great, half the time I use it, for messages, emails, notifications, music, calls. Battery actually lasts TWO days easily, if you don't use it much, three, like in the 'good old days'. And design is excellent, not just stupidly bent in half, like Samsung's Flip (and I did use Samsung for the past 14 years).I got the gold matte version, but thinking of getting another, maybe silver, if there's no new model coming.P.S. I've dropped it twice, first time hitting a metal shopping cart and falling to granite floor, second onto street brick - nothing broke or cracked, just some scratches. Past 'regular' phones I dropped like that, Note 3, etc, cracked the glass screen immediately."
A great idea on paper..A complicated disaster in real use.,NelsonA,"September 28, 2021",4.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"The input is done by rubbing the fingers across the screen which may or not work. Or this action will take you to the wrong screen.. A lot of time is wasted trying to get to the right place..nothing is simple . There are direct steps. Worse of all, making a call, or getting around all unwanted software and spam, is a challenge.It does require a lot of studying and memorization of all the steps need to do anything. Not user friendly, particularly for senior citizens used to pushing a dot , a square or an arrow to get anywhere."
Connect android to laptop.,none,"September 28, 2021",1.0,Style: RAZR 5GColor: Polished Graphite,Verified Purchase,Connect android to laptop for downloads and uploads fail. What a waste of money.
"Less than 1 year old,and quit Charging!!!!",Rose N.,"September 28, 2021",1.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"This piece of junk, won't charge Wirelessly,and this phone was expensive,but at less than 1 year old, won't hold a charge using the cord either."
Disappointed!,Christina Cobb,"September 20, 2021", 3.,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"I have had moto for a few years. I preferred the durability, camera and battery life. Mostly, moto play and z. I broke my last and ended up with a Samsung. Not a fan so I bought this edge. The camera isn't that great. Considering I use my gps for work the battery is ok, I only have to charge once a day. And I am not a fan of the actual ""edge"" screen. Overall decent phone but so disappointed in the camera. 😭"
Love this phone,Shelby Morgen,"September 11, 2021",5.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"Not 5G, according to my local Verizon retail store -- the same store that told be these WERE 5G when they wanted to sell me one for almost twice as much, right before they discovered they didn't have any in stock -- but it's a lot faster loading then my old phone, and I saved over $400 not buying it from the Verizon store. Does everything I need it to. I'm running off wi-fi most of the time anyway."
Screen issues deem this phone useless.,Mike,"September 10, 2021",2.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"I wanted to keep this phone so bad. I love all Motorola phones I've had in the past and my last Motorola lasted me 5 years! I was hoping this would be a great replacement. I actually loved the curved screen and all the features this phone provides. BUT, the screen would start leaving purple marks after 10 minutes of continuous screen time. When at the darkest setting, watching movies, the black shade colors would be giant pixels. The phone was updated with Android 11 and up to date and the screen issues persist so I had return it because I was not fully satisfied and feel this product would not last me for my desired ownership duration. Ended going with a Moto One 5g ACE."
Motorola RAZR Fits In My Vest Pocket,LARRY B. REED,"September 7, 2021",5.0,Style: RAZR 5GColor: Blush Gold,Verified Purchase,I love the style and 21st century features of this 5G smart phone.I can't wait for the 2022 model.
Design very good but I’ve got issues with it,Client d'Amazon,"September 3, 2021",2.0,Style: RAZR 5GColor: Polished Graphite,Verified Purchase,There’s a red patch appearing on my external screen right from day one and I’m onto day three now.Internal screen quality is poor. Too many bumps on the internal screen apart from the middle crease and makes noise while closing.
Unauthorized seller of Motorola and terrible support from Motorola,Erica Gualberto Pongelupe Giacoia,"August 31, 2021",1.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,The seller is not an unauthorized seller of Motorola. I had two problems with the phone and at the second time. Motorola was also terrible in handle the situation. I am extremely disappointed with Motorolla and I recommend Amazon to do not let unauthorized sellers sell products
Always make sure it's not refurbished,Krystal Adomaico,"August 30, 2021",1.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"I was able to use it for only 48 days and it stopped working, it was refurbished. Unfortunately for me Amazon couldn't exchange it for me because it was more than 30 days of purchase. Waste of my hard earned money. Be careful when buying. Please don't make the same mistake"

My Brand New Phone Broke,Kindle Customer,"August 29, 2021",1.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"Literally fell off my nightstand and landed on carpet. I don't know how this ended in tragedy, but here I am with a broke phone. It was even in a case. Definitely not as sturdy as my last phone :("
Horrible Phone,Reagan Ward,"August 25, 2021",1.0,,,"The worst phone I have ever used. Screens crap, battery life is crap, everything about it is crap. I should have folded and finally got an iPhone instead."
THIS PHONE IS 100$ VALUE AS IF THE BATTARY WILL LIVE,Manar Ismail,"August 22, 2021",1.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"The battery doesn't last for a few months. It is completely died after 7 months although I don't use my phone a lot. it is just to read messages and emails. I don't use my phone to browse social media or do any task. Also, I had to charge it all night every day. now, the battery did not fully charge. Don't buy"
"Outstanding, exceptional, tremendously excellent...but flawed",Denny T.,"August 20, 2021", 4.,,,"I've had mine since Dec 2020. Absolutely fantastic phone! User interface is amazing. I love the swipe commands this phone offers.External screen is a battery saver. With the battery not being the strongest in the first place, using the external screen can balance it out.It would be better if an SD card could be put in it, and the camera needs to be improved, but the biggest flaw is that it CANNOT CHARGE WIRELESSLY. For as wonderful of a phone this is, it should have that feature.All in all if you like a well designed, compact phone. This is it."
Dont waste your money,Jamie,"August 18, 2021",1.0,Style: RAZR 5GColor: Polished Graphite,Verified Purchase,"Ive had to RMA this phone 4 times now for a plethora of random issues. First phone creaked insanely loud right out of the box, second phone a single line of pixels died right in the middle of the screen, third phone another block of pixels died, I havent received my 4th RMA yet but I can tell you one thing.. I'll NEVER be buying another Motorola phone again. Their RMA timeline is fine, its just pretty annoying as a customer to have to RMA your phone once a month. Look elsewhere (like Samsung Fold) if you're looking for a reliable foldable because this aint it. JUNK."

Great phone!,Rebekah Lease,"August 13, 2021",5.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,Battery life is great. I have never ran out of juice. I don't change it every day. Photos are awesome! Good size and weight!
"Beware, buy the protections plan if you plan on buying this phone.",Nikos,"August 10, 2021",1.0,Style: RAZR 5GColor: Liquid Mercury,Verified Purchase,"Phone is cool, I love the look, but more of a conversational piece than a useful  phone. Photos are ""ok"" at best and wifi and cell service can be spotty sometimes.What ever you do if you purchase this phone, buy the protection plan. I broke the outside screen and was quoted $969 for a ""replacement/repair"" fee. At least with Apple they work with you if something happens with the phone with or with out a protection plan.For a phone that didnt gain much traction, you would think they would take care of the customers who purchased them. I guess I will be looking for a new phone."

This phone is not repairable. Buy the replacement insurance.,Marvin J Smejkal,"July 31, 2021",2.0,Style: RAZR 5GColor: Blush Gold,Verified Purchase,"This phone is not repairable. Buy the replacement insurance. The Motorola plan is to charge $900.00 to replace/repair. If the phone drops as little as 18"" it will crack and get worse as time goes till the screen is falling apart. The problem seems to be that the glass is under some stress wrapping around the side. This is an unnecessary place to have the glass. There is no display all the way to the sides."
Great phone at a great price,Kathy,"July 27, 2021",5.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,This is my third conscuetive Motorola phone over the last 1 years.  It works without shortcomings for my  needs at 1/2 the price of other 5G 256 memory phones.  Highly recommended.

It was an upgrade from a MotoG Power.Reviews I saw trashed the speakers,I only have a issue with the phone speaker being lacking but serviceable.Over all for under $1000 I consider it a best buy."
Won't charge after less than a year.,Milo Kovet,"July 24, 2021",1.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,I bought this phone in October of 2020 and it stopped charging in July 2021. It didn't even last a year! I'm done. Going to buy an iPhone AND buying it directly from the company. Amazon only offered returns and support for a measly 3 months on this $530.00 phone!
"Bad Screen, battery, can't hold a charge. No time to play. Don't buy .  Disappointed.",L K,"July 21, 2021",1.0,,,"Returned to a staple. Screen tanked, turned  green.  holdp change of $400 plus on my cc, get second one which of course is ALWAYS refurbished,  now lose 4%battery unused every 20 minutes,  no wireless battery charging.  Seems like they haven't improved much with new models either. Specifically wanted no bloatware phone but moto may as well uber me directly to Apple store which I've avoided.I don't have time for their epic failure and just Google the videos and instructions.  That's how bad the battery and intentional selling of a known screen  issue was when I bought . How many employees gave good reviews because I hate Samsung but Motorola has REALLY failed including rude reps even when I give them a case number. Huge lose."
So far the best moto phone I've invested on.,Sean Smittle,"July 19, 2021",5.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"I like the unique edge and OLED screen, storage space and sound quality with fast processor.so far I have nothing negative to say."
Muy bueno,Mel J Maff,"July 15, 2021",5.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,Muy bueno. Verye good
I am surprised how much I like this phone,Kindle Customer,"July 15, 2021",4.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"I am a 20 year Motorola user who was ready to move on to Samsung after my Z3 because the G-series and Motorola One series seem so blah and underwhelming.  But the latest Samsung phones do not have an SD slot, which was a deal breaker.  The Samsung A series has them, but are more expensive and lower capability. The edge display seems strange since Samsung already moved away from it, and it is easy to see why.  It looks cool, but has very little usefulness.  The rest rest of the phone is surprising good.  The display is crisp, sharp, responsive.  I see reviews about edge discolorations, but I have not seen any issues.  Connectivity through BT, Wi-Fi and 4G is good (I have not switched to a 5G plan and cannot evaluate 5G performance).  The camera is outstanding for this level of phone, and definitely a step up from the Moto Z3 camera, especially the digital zoom. Battery life has been very good, finishing most days with 60% remaining.  One day, I navigated for 3 hours with google maps and still had 20% battery at the end of the day.  My only real disappointment is no Moto Voice anymore.  I always like it better than Google Assistant, but Motorola no longer includes it in their phones."
Doesn't hold a charge,kay,"July 15, 2021",3.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"I have to charge my phone 2x a day.  I replaced my 5 year phone for this.  When I first got it, I didn't have to charge more than every 3 days. The screen rounds the sides and can be anoying.Great camera."
Moto Edge,Kurt,"July 11, 2021",5.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,Excellent phone
Amazing flagship for it's price,Thomas C Ballant,"July 6, 2021",5.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"I came from a Moto Z4 and let me tell you, It's a huge upgrade, the fingerprint sensor in the screen works much faster, the cameras are pretty good (not the best out there but great for its price), the 90Hz screen refresh rate is so smooth that I will never go back to a 60Hz screen and the screen itself is so crisp and runs android 11 like butter (you will have too turn off ""Enable blurs"" in androids developer settings so that the phone does run like butter in Android 11). Highly highly highly recommend this phone"
Don't buy Motorola. Buy apple or Samsung because they have part for replacement.,Tony Bell,"July 6, 2021",1.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"Less than a year, touchscreen not working properly. Customer service sucks. No help at all."
HANDY AND ELEGANT,murtala shawai,"July 6, 2021",5.0,,,"There is nothing to dislike. Motorola has been out of Nigeria's market for long, So I was happy to come across this product online. Also glad that it was unlocked for usage in my country. I love it."
The phone functions well. Battery life is the best.,Desiree case,"July 4, 2021",5.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"After seeing up the phone I realized it was used. It had many wi fi connections, and had been checked into many locations that are not mine. I paid for a new phone and that is what I was expecting the first phone was new but had heating problems. I assumed the phone they replaced it with would be new also."
This is a very nice phone,lynn tassos,"June 29, 2021",5.0,Style: RAZR 5GColor: Polished Graphite,Verified Purchase,"Plenty of speed, battery lasts more than a day (for me), the external display handles a lot of the functionality without the need to open the phone, and it feels solid. The cost is high for this device (new), but I bought a used version for a lot less money, which was actually flawless (no scratches or imperfections).My only issue is the smoothness of the phone making it slippery to hold. I strongly suggest getting a case with some ""texture"" for a better grip."
Awesome phone,James,"June 26, 2021",5.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"I bought this phone went it’s awesome!!! The display when watching a movie is like you’re watching the movie while they are Shooting it. The picture is that clear, battery life and sound is awesome"
Horrible phone,Yona,"June 25, 2021",1.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"Horrible phone. Broke soon after I bought it. Never has so many problems with a phone before. Invest in a better phone, not worth the hassle. Customer service didn't help at all either."
Verizon customers beware!,Amazon Customer,"June 22, 2021",3.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"If you are planning to use this phone with Verizon, be aware that the wifi calling feature is not supported by Verizon and will not work. That said, it has been a very good phone since December of 2020 other than the fingerprint reader. I'm not sure  if this a phone problem or a user problem though."
Avoid avoid avoid,NegativeONE,"June 15, 2021",1.0,,,"Garbage phone. Camera malfunctioned within two weeks. Constant updates. Glad I was just test running the phone, but I feel bad for everyone else who bought it."
Fast responses.,peaches,"June 14, 2021",3.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"Difficult to get used to using. Was accidentally put on a voice response app, which I couldn't undo. Visit to Verizon store three times, so far."

An unforgettable shopping,Amazon Customer,"June 2, 2021",5.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"I like all about the Motorola edge, beautiful design, great features, nice touching and affordable price, really a wonderful experience."
Awesome phone!  Definitely recommend!,Adrienne J.,"June 2, 2021",5.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"This is an awesome phone at a great price point (less than $500 ea when we purchased it).My husband recommended it.  I originally planned to purchase a Samsung- loyal customer.  Husband heard about Moto Edge and looked up specks on Amazon which is where we purchased the two phones.  It was cheaper than Samsung S20, better camera (my perk) and faster processor (husband's perk-gamer).It has a sleek design, super cool features (i.e. 3 finger touch for screenshot, quick turn on feature for camera and flashlight, live screen record, screen call feature, enhanced google assistant features) and AWESOME camera.  I love taking pictures and adding cool affects (i.e.blur).Added bonus... there's plenty of YouTube reviews that will show you basic functionality and additional cool features about the phone.  It also comes with the Android 11 update which has some pretty cool tools but you have to be sure to accept the update."
Very nice,Camy cam,"May 29, 2021",5.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,Awesome phone
Long battery life,Marion L. Jenkins,"May 28, 2021",5.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"Love the battery life! So far it is lasting for 2 days on a charge. The speed at which apps load is phenomenal. Only Con is the Bluetooth has connection issues. Other than that, I love it. Never used Motorola before, so I'm pleasently surprised with this phone. Currently using it on Straight Talk. I did have to get a new SIM card, but that's not really that big of a deal. Highly recommend."
Fragile and no one repairs,Evan Tracey,"May 27, 2021",1.0,,,"So neat phone,  screen breaks after 3 weeks.  come to find out no one fixes these.  One place was 30 miles and I live in a large east coast city.  Motorla wanted more than the phone cost to repair.  Total joke.  Dont buy unless you want to keep in bubble wrap."
"Good battery life, nice screen, works well sounds good",MB in the OC,"May 26, 2021",5.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"The fingerprint reader works better than the one on the stylus 2020.  The cameras work well, love the 2x optical camera.  This has a premium phone feel at an affordable price point.  It’s not “flagship” but the user experience is close, and it is much less expensive."
Phone functions,Jose coronado,"May 26, 2021",3.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"Great working phone my only issues is that the screen is a little clumsy as in you'll accidentally swipe back to previous page since the ""back button"" is you swiping either  corner of the screen. Another issue is when you watch a video on your phone sideways your fingers will be touching the edge of the screen so when you want to fast forward or reverse it doesn't always want to until you make sure your fingers aren't accidentally touching the screen. Other than that it's a decent phone. 5G still sucks in most places though."
I love Motorola,Patricia Brittingham,"May 25, 2021",5.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"My favorite phones have always been Motorola's, so I'm partial. The primary reason I like them is because I'm not gentle with my phones, they get tossed onto the table and dropped frequently and Motorola's can take a beatingThe only complaints that I have with the Edge is night shots with the camera suck and finding a decent case for it was a bit of a challenge. Battery life isn't anything like what the Moto Z Play had (I would only have to charge that phone once or twice a week). Other than that, I love it."
"I wouldn't recommend this phone, because of the poor design of the edges",Amazon Customer,"May 24, 2021",1.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"I loved the phone, but I didn't like the fact that the edges on phone aren't protected. If phone were to be droped it would surely crack. I Love Motorola phones, but they should of just kept the original phone edges on this one. I had problems with the slot for the sim card as well. It wouldn't open🥺"
Failed Efforts. Disaster of a phone,vq35de,"May 24, 2021",2.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"1. Body: Sleek and tall. Premium look. Glossy back a little prone to smudges but overall an impressive looking device2. Screen: Large. Thin bezels. Crisp. Bright colors. A bit too reflective in the sun even at max brightness. This is where I struggled a bit with the viewing angle. No matter how I looked at it it was too bright and shiny from the sun's reflection3: Buttons and misc: Power and volume buttons to the right, easily reachable. Charging and audio outlet at the bottom. Fast charging works beautifully. Glad they kept the outlet for headphone jack4: Speakers: Dual. Volume level does go up quite a but but also comes with a fair bit of distortion at max volume5: Processor: Snappy. Refresh rate is ultra fast and smooth. Highly impressed BUT the phone had a very high number of freezes on Android 10. It would take it 15-20 seconds and then resume normal function. Haven't noticed that on 11 but then again it's only been a few days since I updated6: Camera: No the best. Decent pictures but autofocus is constantly trying to adjust which can be frustrating. Fair bit of noise on zoom. GCam installed while on 10 fixed the camera issue7: Battery: Mediocre. Having a big battery is meaningless if the internals eat it up too fast. Due to the settings i selected, phone woke up every few seconds all by its own. ""Keep phone on longer while looking at it"" feature was the worst because it kept the phone on the whole time even when I WASN'T looking at it. All these moto features and upgrades didn't do the battery any favors8: Apps and features: This is where the phone's shortcomings were the biggest. Screen casting is NOT possible unless it's chromecast which is such a disappointment. My older Samsung and LG phones didn't do such atrocity. A constant notifications from moto to do this and that to the phone was no less annoying. Bluetooth worked fine on 10 but it has been a disaster since moving to 11. Phone only connects to one of the three things it was already connected to before. Screen fingerprint reader doesn't always work perfectly and that part of the touchscreen doesn't work while on homescreen. No wireless charging and edge display is very prone to accidental touches.All in all I feel like I paid $400 too much for this phone."
Great phone so far.,Amazon Customer,"May 23, 2021",5.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,On Verizon and had been working great so far.
Could Have Been Great,Sal Seminara,"May 21, 2021",3.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"The phone has a nice popular form factor with sharp screen and good battery life.  The problems with the phone come when you try and mimic the functionality of your old phone, Android 11 cant hold a candle to Android 9 but this phone supports 5G so I'm kind of stuck having to use it as broadband has evolved.  If Google persists in emulating Microsoft in diminishing functionality and ease of use, we will all be using Apple phones soon."
Nostalgia,Ismail,"May 20, 2021",5.0,Style: RAZR 5GColor: Liquid Mercury,Verified Purchase,Nostalgia. I love it

Carrier matching,dan,"May 11, 2021",4.0,Style: RAZR 5GColor: Polished Graphite,Verified Purchase,"The phone overall is great, however if it was matched up to the carrier that I use then all the carrier applications would transfer much smoother and work better."
Doesn't do anything well.,SkekTek,"May 11, 2021",2.0,,,"The good:It's an old school style flip phone with a folding screen.It's small (when folded).I would also include that it provides the tactile joy of flipping the phone closed to hang up on someone but that doesn't work on my phone (yes, it's enabled in the Phone settings).The bad:This thing is so expensive that you have to add a case to keep your investment safe which doubles the bulk and negates one of the few good things this phone had going for it.Marginal battery life. With lite usage you can make it through the day.The touchscreen isn't very sensitive. You have to press pretty hard and even then I find that it doesn't always register - it makes texting a frustrating experience.The ugly:The screen stops responding often - especially when plugged in. Frequently I have to turn the screen on and off again.'Flip phone camera quality' - the camera doesn't take very good pictures. It responds slowly and if you don't hold it absolutely still you'll end up with a blurry photo. Also I can't seem to turn off auto flash - even in 'manual' mode the phone will randomly add flash (which adds to the already lengthy time required to take a picture).Overall:For a premium price you're getting a half baked product. I don't mind being cut by bleeding edge technology but this thing needs to go back in the oven for a while longer."
It's been a couple of months since I shipped this item back and have had zero response or refund,Ansy emmanuel jean baptiste,"May 10, 2021",2.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,It's been a couple of months since I shipped this item back and have had zero response or refund
Folding phones are totally cool!,P. Schneider,"May 10, 2021",5.0,Style: RAZR 5GColor: Polished Graphite,Verified Purchase,This is the coolest smartphone. I love folding tech. It’s kitchy.
Bad screen after a few months,Amazon Customer,"May 9, 2021",1.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
        


   This worked flawlessly for several months, the screen started to display a bleeding and warping effect with prolonged use, and would go away if it was given a break. It got worse over time, and the breaks were less effective, over time. Now it's at a point where use for more than a few minutes at a time makes it unusable. Until this issue started, it was an amazing product. Apparently it's an extremely common issue with this model"
The Motorola edge is a good phone.,Amazon Customer,"May 8, 2021",4.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,Love the Motorola edge..Dislike is battery don't last but overall good phone . Need the android update 11.
love this phone,marlan thompson,"May 8, 2021",5.0,Style: RAZR 5GColor: Liquid Mercury,Verified Purchase,"Moto does it again....all the features you would expect in a smart device but folds in half .  Reminds me of the now retro Razr that I liked years ago.  I can slip it in my shirt pocket and go.  A few things I enjoy are making and receiving phone calls,  text, IM, email  and so much more all without opening the device.  The front screen capabilities are wonderful.  Camera and battery life are a great bonus as well.  Thanks Motorola it is a head turner as well.  Plus the grand kids like that I can bend glass.  I enjoy carrying a phone again..!!"
Love hate Relationship.,Raviken,"May 8, 2021",5.0,Style: RAZR 5GColor: Polished Graphite,Verified Purchase,"It's a flip phone with the old Motorola look. It's great, but beyond that, I find that the specs for the phone are underwhelming, the gps tracking is a a hit and miss...the clamshell design naturally protects the  main screen from scratches which is great. I can't say the same for the outer shell as it easily scratches.But it's a flip phone.."
"Design is to admire, but hinge is too noisy",Mr B,"May 5, 2021",3.0,Style: RAZR 5GColor: Liquid Mercury,Verified Purchase,"Nice phone, but creaks when opening and closing. Called Moto, no acceptable answer, had to return it to amazon. Re purchased it hoping to get a quiet unit, but sadly it creaks even louder than the first one. Lovely..."
es lo que esperaba,Humberto Olmos,"May 3, 2021",5.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,excelente producto y muy rápida entrega
great phone and fantastic camera,nigel,"May 2, 2021",5.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,great phone and fantastic camera
Motorola what happened,ALLAN,"May 2, 2021",1.0,Style: Motorola EdgeColor: Solar Black,Verified Purchase,I am not at all impressed the camera is decent but the phone lags badly I am not sure if I received a defective unit or what is going on but the phone is not even a month in use and I am already missing the free samsung A20 my service provider gave me for switching over. Other than that phone looks decent and it's pretty well built looks like it can take a good drop better quality than iphone other than the **** phone freezing when I play a video or browse the web . I have never had a phone be this slow right off the box . It's supposed to be a 2020 phone but as mentioned my older samsung A20 I received for free never ever froze on me . I am now in the market for a different phone I tried to give motorola a shot but sadly say not what I expected . I hope I received a defective unit and someone else does not have this problem this is insane for a quite expensive phone
Good Device for the Price of $499 USD + taxes,Eric G,"April 30, 2021",4.0,,,"I've used many Motorola devices before. As a matter of fact, it was my first Android phone after giving up on the iPhone (I was using Motorola Atrix 4G -- one of the 1st to have 4G, a physical fingerprint scanner and Corning Gorilla Glass).LIKES:*Price: $499 USD + taxes (as of April 2021)*1080p 90 Hz curved ""waterfall"" screen*HDR 10 support*Great battery life. Lasts me about 1-1/2 days*Triple camera setup + TOF 3D depth sensor(64 MP wide, 16 MP ultra wide, 8 MP telephoto)*Selfie camera 25 MP can handle Ultra wide + 2x telephoto shots*5G unlocked version works with all GSM carriers ATT, T-Mobile, etc. But only 4G LTE on CDMA such as Boost, etc.*Does NOT support Verizon's 5G UltraWide Band; only 5G Nationwide / 4G LTE CBRS*Expandable storage thru MicroSD card*Taller form factor makes it easier to hold in one hand (at least for me)*FM radio (I know! Even if you never use it)*Headphone jack*Close to Stock Android software, similar to Google Pixel's.GRIPES:(being mindful of its ""budget"" price)*Cameras takes average photos. Night Sight and Portrait View captures is not as sharp. Perhaps a software update will fix it. In contrast, Macro shots are better than expected.*The screen bleeds a bit towards its curved waterfall design; but can be turned off to have a flatter view. It's not as well implemented as Xiaomi's, Samsung's, Vivo's, Oppo's or Huawei's similar curved OLED screens.*Optical Fingerprint scanner is hit or miss. I substituted it for Face Recognition which proves faster with decent lighting.*Stereo speakers are mediocre. Perhaps software update needed for calibration.*18 Watt Turbo Charging is okay, though I wish it was 25 Watt or above.*No Qi Wireless charging (again look at price)*5G only supports sub6 GHz on GSM carriers.*Limited to 4G LTE when using Verizon as carrier (the more expensive Edge+ supports Verizon's 5G mmWave)*The back is a fingerprint magnet.Overall, for its price the Motorola Edge 5G is a great buy for someone looking for an everyday phone that just works. It's Snapdragon 765G processor is reliable and really power efficient especially with 5G, dual-band WiFi AC and Bluetooth 5.1 constantly being on."
