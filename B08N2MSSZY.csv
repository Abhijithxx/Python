None,TT,"December 9, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"Great phone! good battery life, exellent camera quality."
Still learning,Frank B. Felty,"December 7, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"It's really too early to send this survey out as I'm still learning many things about the phone, but can't answer about things here that I haven't worked with as of yet. But right now on what I worked with it's awesome."
Camera quality is perfection!,Naomi,"December 7, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,Had this phone for months now and and my husband also bought one off here and we haven't had any issues. Works great! And is legit! Bought this for the camera and it doesn't disappoint
Come on its the ultra,J-FIZZLE,"December 5, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"I mean what do you expect except what you buy it for, mine works great and I almost never put it down bc I'm a freaking insomniac but also it's nice bc the file system that allows you to put an external USB storage on it and you can watch bootleg movies through it or just use its file system similar to how a computer works samsung in general is more for the computer user rather than just overall user friendly if you want a phone to call use tic tok snapchat and take photos, get an iPhone. But if you want a phone that can do all that and be fully customizable, have a compatible storage format to be used with windows, and have a reliable bigger battery, bigger camera sensors and just in general better instruments at hand go for samsung"
I recommend getting an apple phone,Kimberly Harrell,"December 5, 2021",1.0,,,"If you value talking to people and being able to hear them without a constant echo, I would recommend going with an Apple phone. Absolutely horrendous especially with how much these phones cost. Do not purchase, it's complete junk!"
S21 ultra,nadiya,"December 5, 2021",4.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,Battery drain so fast.
Poor data reception,Sergei N.,"December 4, 2021",4.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"I've bought it in hope that it will have better reception than my 7 yo Note 4, and in order to get a working version of Android. My, was I wrong! As Verizon techy explained, s21 needs about 3 times stronger signal than Note 4. The progress getting stranger every day. I ordered today a signal booster, lets see what happens.Overall, its a pretty toy with Android 12 (will last for a while)."
Awesome phone!,stephen raccio,"December 4, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"I was originally going to order this phone from Samsung but had to wait 3 weeks for it to ship! Amazon had the phone delivered to my house in 2 days! Thank you Amazon! The phone has an incredible display, is lightning fast with a great fingerprint reader for all my banking and investment apps. I love the phone!"
Worst Samsung phone ever,Amazon Customer,"December 4, 2021",2.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"This is the worst Samsung phone ever and that includes the note that exploded in people's pockets. My friend has the A32 and his phone out performs mine on every level. The battery on this phone doesn't even last a full day. There is no SD card slot. There is a hole in the middle of the screen. When setting up for the first time there are sections that say optional but are required to set it up. My suggestion is if you are going to buy a Samsung phone then upgrade and get the A32. After this piece of crap, i won't be buying another Samsung product. Who ever designed this paper weight was either drunk, high on drugs, or disgruntled and on their way out."
No estaba sellado,Jhoan Seo,"December 3, 2021",3.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"El producto se supone que era nuevo pero no vino sellado, lastimosamente me lo trajeron a otro pa√≠s y no puedo regresarlo"
"Received FAULTY product, purchase from store.",Dk.oso,"December 2, 2021",1.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"I ordered this phone on holiday season, end up receiving faulty product. Don't purchase from amazon, better visit local store."
Is it worth $1200?? No. Needs more storage,Levi Tafari,"December 1, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,I love the phone. I am already out of room though and all I have is videos and pics of my son. You can not add any external storage so all you get is what you get. I got the ultra and still ran out of room within 4 months.
It's omplete,Amazon Customer,"December 1, 2021",2.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,For the cost of the product it should have come with a charger and a sim card spent the whole day finding these items. omplete
Awesome large tablet,Cynthia Yeager,"December 1, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,Large screen and very easy to use. Similar to my Galaxy phone.
"So far so good, but .....",EDD,"November 30, 2021",4.0,,,"I bought the Note 20 Ultra at BB.  I really liked the phone.  6 months later the screen died.  Samsung replaced the screen at no charge.  A month later the phone got damp and died.  Samsung said it failed beyond repair because of water damage but agreed to issue a full refund because they thought the new screen did not seal properly.  They did not have a phone to replace it with so after some haggling  they said they would give me a full refund.  It has been 5 months now and they still have not sent me a refund despite my endless calls and emails.I bought the S21 Ultra since i could not wait for Samsung to send me another phone.  So far so good. I do like it but wonder how long it will last.Before the Note 20 I had a S8+ and loved it, but after a couple years the battery started buldging out of the back of the phone.  The Samsung repair shop said it would eventually explode!My impression is that Samsung makes great phones as long as they work.  The problem is 2 out of 3 have not worked for an extended period of time, and the 3rd phone is only a couple months old."
"My phone don't have charger, its only cord wire I saw why?",Abimbola,"November 30, 2021",1.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,
My new favorite phone,Jesse H.,"November 29, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,Upgraded from an S8 to this S21 Ultra. I love everything about this phone from the cameras to the battery. It's a very nice phone that can do everything I want. Most of the bad reviews come from people complaining about storage but I don't need much anyway. Plus there's google photos/drive for that anyway
No charger?,Jordan,"November 29, 2021",1.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"All that came with the phone was the pin pusher, a USB-c to USB-C cable, a reference guide, and a terms and conditions pamphlet. For some reason I can't believe that a phone would come without a transformer or usb to usb-c cable."
Love this phone so far,Altmed,"November 28, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"Love this phone! Snappy fast prossessor, still discovering everything it can do.Cameras are very nice as well.I did already half fill the memory, which is easy to do with 4k & 8k video and high resolution still pics. Be sure to backup frequently!!!The 256 or 512 models may seem a bit better, but are hard to find and you'll still have to offload videos and pics anyhow.Screen is very clear resolution.Functions much like a computer, and in some cases, can take the place of one, depending on what you do with your's. Certainly runs circles around many/most cameras...including my old Nikon! Very nice pics taken with this camera, and I haven't even gone deep into setting yet. A tri-pod and gamble will add to the usefulness. Pretty amazing camera!"
"Charging cord is usbc to usbc, wall charger not included",Kaitlyn,"November 28, 2021",1.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,So I was very confused recieving this phone. I opened it up and the cord that came with it is a usbc to usbc. The little pamphlets that come with the phone dont explain what this cord is.  How very cheap of a company to change its charging cord from the widely used usb to usbc cord and not provide the new brick to actually charge the phone for the new style cord. Havent even gotten to use this phone yet and im already displeased. You cant tell me for the price tag of phones nowadays that they cant include the proper brick.
you cant complain,ZILLA,"November 28, 2021",5.0,,,"- if you been complaining about camera the default is set to 12mp, change the resolution at the very top to 108mp- u obviously didnt read that phone didnt come with charger before complaining"
Feels like a refurbished and not new,Kou Yang,"November 28, 2021",2.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"I bought a lot of Samsung phones in the past. Ranging from note 8 to note 9 and then to the s21 ultra. There were nothing weird or wrong with them. I decided to buy another s21 ultra as a Christmas gift for my little brother. When it came, I checked to see if there were anything wrong with it before wrapping it in a present box.To my surprise it was DIFFERENT. The date, time, and location were set to China. An alarm clock that was already set up to 6:00 am.Not sure if this is how it is supposed to be because I'm 100% sure it said U.S version. My first one that I ordered didn't have anything like this. I'm going to make a phone plan for this one to see if it goes through because it stated FACTORY UNLOCKED.All in all, not really happy about this one."
Quality of the phone,Amazon Customer,"November 26, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,I love this phone does everything i want it to do
the photos are pixelated. Not a huge leap from the s9. And no phone jack!!!,OZol,"November 26, 2021",3.0,,,the photos are pixelated. Not a huge leap from the s9. And no phone jack!!!
Love it,Tamara,"November 26, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,Am going to have to contact someone at Amazon. Great phone. I have not been offered insurance at all from anywhere. The phone is expensive and I paid for it in one payment. Feel like a sitting duck hoping nothing happens to it before I figure out how to get some phone insurance going on it!
Not a Dual Sim,Mario,"November 24, 2021",1.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"Even tough it says on the specs it is a dual sim, it is not!, doesn't have a dual sim tray nor a 1 physical sim and 1 esim. This seems to be only in US, so if you are looking for the dual sim, look for the International version. (Usually the model will have DS at the end)"
$1300.00 and no charger?,Amazon Customer,"November 23, 2021",4.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"My wife was anxious and excited to receive her new Galaxy, 5G S21 Ultra cell phone. However, upon delivery she discovered no charger was included! For that price  and no $5.00 charger included?Now we have to go out and find one. Otherwise, I ASSUME the phone is top notch...but she hasn't had a chance to find out due to the lack of a charger. Really?"
Best Cellphone nowadays,Edilton Rodrigues,"November 20, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"Excellent cellphone. Smooth screen, fast face recognition, great camera."
The phone I've been waiting for.,George Hight,"November 18, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"Went from an S7 Edge to the S21 Ultra so it was night\day as far as performance, the camera- I haven't even dove into all of the fantastic features but I will around the holidays for sure. Using this phone between the home\work wi-fi environments works perfectly and the 5G is a blistering fast upgrade. I'll be happy with this one for some years to come."
New phone that kept freezing,Amazon costumer,"November 16, 2021",1.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"Terrible...a new phone to keep freezing like this...And Amazon are getting worse and worse when it comes to returns...I'm waiting for 3 wks now after I dropped off the phone and they are trying to say ...oh,when we'll receive your idem we will issue your refund...even if I have the return label confirmation and the confirmation from UPS...crazy"
No SD card,Stephen,"November 16, 2021",3.0,,,"The no SD card made me sick when I realize this one the first day. Had I know, I would not have bought the phone. I bought the lowest memory version because I have a Samsung 256MB card (expensive) that I used in my Galaxy S9 that is completely useless now. Also, the charger that I had to upgrade to for the S9, not recommended to be used with the 21 so that is a useless 50 dollar paperweight as well, times 2 actually because had to upgrade my car charger as well. I will say the camera is pretty kick ass. The video steadying feature works great and with the 100x camera, I have been able to take impressive pictures of the moon. So overall, good but not great."
Horrible customer service,Geoffery Hillberg,"November 15, 2021",1.0,,,"Had this phone for a month and something happen to where m Sim doesn't work no more. Called them up to see what they can do and they want more money from me to fix it. Morale of the story, don't but it."
Everything seems to work as expected.,Amazon Customer,"November 15, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,Only feature causing problems is the fingerprint sensor. Finding a screen protector that works with phone has proved difficult. Battery life has been awesome.
ZOOM IS UNREAL MUST SEE TO BELIEVE,Andy M,"November 14, 2021",5.0,,,"This phone is a masterpiece. The first phone I've owned where I have no complaints. The camera is next level. The 3x and 10x optical zoom are a ""you have to see to believe it"" sort of thing. It's utterly insane that I can shoot surfing at 10x zoom in 4k 60FPS with incredible depth of color and unbelievable image stabilization. This technology is almost scary good. It makes you wonder what could possibly be next. Going all the way out to the 75x-100x optical/digital combo zoom, you can take pictures of the moon that will blow your mind. It shouldn't be possible to focus on something that far away with such precision with a phone that you are holding in your hand, yet these guys have pulled it off through whatever advanced software they've installed. 10/10 would buy again."
Great phone but got a defective unit,Jess dela Fuente,"November 11, 2021",1.0,,,The phone itself was great but just about 5-6weeks after I purchased it I noticed there was a weird orange/yellow spot on the left corner. I contacted amazon but unfortunately I was outside the replacement period which is understandable so they directed me to samsung to get an in warranty repair. Samsung then pointed me to go to a local ubreakifix shop that fixes phones for them but they said they cant handle warranty repairs on any location in the bay area right now so I contacted samsung again. They told me to try a different ubreakifix location which told me the same thing. I eventually had the phone shipped to a samsung repair center and I got it back today. They said they tested the device but they were unable to find anything wrong with it but as soon as I turned the device on the spot is still there. It seems like i'm stuck with a phone that has a defective screen now cause no one can help me. While I'm writing this review I've been on the phone with Samsung going back and forth with the repair center and tech support for about 30 minutes. I've been using flagship galaxy phones for the last 8 yrs now but I probably won't buy samsung again.
It's a Samsung. Quality is in the name.,LJ,"November 7, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,Amazing cellphone. Looking forward to the next top-tier S series phone.
love phone but battery won't charge now,Elizabeth Jerrell,"November 7, 2021",2.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,for the past 3 or 4 days battery just Flys to drained then when you think it's charging guess what it turns off and 5 or 6 hrs later you have maybe 5% I'm in process of getting it refunded or replaced
Why didn't my phone come with a Sim card,Fred Flintstone,"November 4, 2021",4.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,My phone didn't come with a Sim cars and now I'm having a hard time doing anything in this stupid phone
i love it,isael sanchez,"November 3, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,I feel satisfied with this purchase.
It Is a Wonderful Phone but It Does Have Some Serious Issues!,Radashack,"October 29, 2021",3.0,,,"Although I bought my S21 Ultra 5G directly from Samsung and not from Amazon I felt the need to let people know that although this is a top rated flagship phone many I have come to discover developed an issue which neither Samsung or anybody else, including the Samsung Forum/Members could figure out. It's such a serious problem for me that I have returned the phone to Samsung for a refund!This particular problem apparently is widespread with the Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G and many owners have experienced this issue but chose to ignore it and just keep the phone because of its reputation as being top-of-the-line and just because it apparently impresses their friends to have one!The problem is with the Bluetooth. Using Bluetooth devices such as Bluetooth speakers or earbuds and when streaming music or audiobooks from the phone to earbuds or a Bluetooth speaker, for some unexplained reason after a minute or two the streaming stops, requiring you to either restart the stream from the phone or close the app and restart it again, and even that is not always work!I have literally spent hours a total of more than 11 hours on the phone with Samsung tech support and have written many members in the Samsung forum, and although I got lots of possible fixes, none of them worked! I thought of just factory resetting the phone and try to isolate what app or possibly what Bluetooth device could have been causing the problem, but after spending over thousand dollars for this phone, I was not going to do that when there are phones out there almost as good that never experience this problem!I listen to a lot of audiobooks and music which requires the phone to stream to Bluetooth earbuds or a Bluetooth speaker. This continuous starting and stopping is really a game changer for me. I know it's the phone because even when I use wired earbuds it continues to play but there is a distortion after a couple of minutes which does clear up, and even that is extremely irritating!So I just wanted to write this review to let people know that this is a possibility and if you go on the Internet and read you will see a lot of people are experiencing this just with this phone. The previous phone I had was a Note 20 Ultra 5G, and it did not have this issue ever! The phone I had previous to that was an S 20 Ultra 5G and it never experienced this problem! I have never had a phone since the Galaxy Note 4 years ago that ever did this, and even then with the Note 4 it was taken care of within weeks by an update! The S21 Ultra 5G has been around now for many months and this problem still persists!The other part of this review concerns those people and tech companies that review these new phones! It is clear that most of these people have a preference of phone types and phone manufacturers. To replace this Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G, I have since purchased a OnePlus 9 Pro 5G. To this day no problems with it and no intermittent Bluetooth issues!  I have read so many complaints about the One Plus that were not true that I had to go back and reread many of these complaints to be sure they were talking about the same phone.The bottom line is, if you have owned other flagship phones especially from Samsung there is no giant leap in technology or performance. If you've owned cheap phones, then of course this phone will seem like it came from heaven. If you're used to phones performing everyday tasks without a hitch, this phone is a mixed bag of performance! Even something as simple as getting this phone to connect with the Bluetooth in my Honda vehicle was a challenge, whereas with the One Plus 9 Pro 5G I replaced it with, it did it so quickly that I didn't even realize it had already connected until it got to the part where I had to give my phone a name in Honda Hands-Free Link system.  I don't know if I will ever buy another Samsung phone.Hope this helps!"
"Love it. Works better than I expected . Fast charging, great pictures",Thomas bogan,"October 29, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,Battery life is üëç.  My s20 that the s21 replaced  stopped stop holding a charge after 1 year. This on I am sure will last longer
False advertisement,Pen Name,"October 28, 2021",1.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,Per about information says a travel adapter and a usb connector would come in the box. This is FALSE they do not!!

Meh... I should've jumped ship for the iphone!,Zach olson,"October 22, 2021",3.0,,,"iPhone! Update removed home, multiwindow, and back buttons.. wtf? Swipe feature is so frustrating when trying to scroll through photos and websites.  The Camera is very digital. I honestly dislike it soo much. Battery is OK.. just that.. phone is extremely heavy, and weight is disproportionate to scale due to all the cameras,  no wall charger, no expansion of memory, and if you keep google long enough,  you'll run out of memory in the cloud without paying for extra.All in all, I wish I jumped ship from my LG to Iphone.. only reason I didn't was the fact that the trade in value was $800 to go s21 Vs. Like $400 for IPhone...  dum dum me.."
DOES NOT HAD DUAL SIM,RENNE G A MINGS,"October 20, 2021",1.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,I bought this expensive phone ... not realising it does not carry DUAL SIM.. now I am stuck wid two phones again.. lol  other than that good phone...lol
Best camera out there.,Gingerdanger,"October 13, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,This phone took these moon pics unaided. Just awesome. Battery lasts 10 hours of web surfing. Much better than my old S9+.
No charger,John Roaten,"October 11, 2021",3.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,For the huge price of this phone you would think they could at least include a battery charger...but no!Haven't used phone yet because the battery was only 12%. Maybe a better review later.
Hey apple got rid of it's charger let's do that too!,Jason,"October 8, 2021",1.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,We should do what apple did and just get rid of the headphone jack!!! :D

Battery time is great but camera not as good as expected,Caroline,"October 7, 2021",4.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"I love how long the battery lasts, easily 2d with  normal use. The downside is that it feels a lot heavier than my old phone (Samsung galaxy S7). I bought it mostly for the camera with optical zoom. However, if you use the x10 zoom the pictures will still be blurry (better than normal lense+digital zoom though). Over all, the resolution of the photos are good, but they often end up overexposed and with strange defects that you wouldn't get with a ""regular"" camera. Colors end up a bit colder than I perceive them in real life, very different from the golden tint you get with an iPhone. It doesn't perform well if the light is dim."
Great phone very heavy and very uncomfortable uncomfortable in your pocket,Ryan Hebrink,"October 4, 2021",4.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,Phone is very heavy I got it cause they said it had the best camera on the Market I've looked asked for Google help Samsung help how to get better pictures pictures are OK pictures are OK in very expensive for not getting a great camera

Very poor quality pic/video,Jeannie Snyder,"October 1, 2021",1.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"Bought this phone for the reported EXCELLENT photo/video quality.At first I thought it was ME and I couldn't figure out the features.  Nope. It's the phone.All images and video are poor quality, usually way under exposed.  Everything I shoot requires editing in other platforms.  Seriously regret this purchase."

most likely the last samsung phone I will buy,Amazon Customer,"September 11, 2021",1.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,".. or certainly not spend 1k+ Camera had issues just after a month or so. Support process is very cumbersome. Had issues registering the phone imei ... the service center process is another mess! Didn't have stock of the parts .. so much for a flagship product. I do understand you can get a bad unit, but would have expected a straight forward  support that they would send me a replacement unit and then I send back the one with issue."

"Can't say enough bad things about Samsung (Horrible customer service for a $1,000 piece of trash)",RPB,"August 28, 2021",1.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"After owning the phone for about 45 days, the screen began to flicker.  There is not a single scratch on this phone.  I wouldn't even unbox it until I got my Otterbox case for it.  I called Amazon.  Amazon was very helpful.  They told me that it was past 30 days and I could not return it but it was still under the manufacturer warranty and connected me with Samsung.  Samsung seemed like they were going to help.  They told me me since it was such a recent purchase it was still under warranty and gave me a list of local shops to bring it to be repaired, free of charge.  I brought it to the shop (UbreakIFix), the kid behind the counter rang me up for $380.00.  I told him Samsung said it would be taken care of.  The kid tried turning the screen on a few times, when it wouldn't turn on, he whacked it on the heel of his palm.  The kid pointed to a tiny black speck in the corner of the screen and said ""you have to pay because of this"".  I let him know it wasn't there before he whacked it and left the store.  I called Samsung customer care and they told me that there is absolutely nothing they can do about it.  Stick to Apple, at least they have decent in-house customer care."
So far so good,Amazon Customer,"August 27, 2021",4.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,Pretty PETTY that they charge all this money for this phone and can't provide an adapter with it. I don't know how many people they think have type-C outlets.  The phone is an inch longer and heavier than my previous phone. Good to have a wireless charger for this phone however that can be a challenge in your car.
"Amazing camera, super fast, battery life isn't the best",Sebastian Sanchez,"August 27, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,Amazing phone. Top notch camera has given me amazing pictures on my multimonth vacation (why I purchased the phone). Only downside is the battery life isn't the best due to the huge screen size. Great phone I would highly recommend.
No es bueno en algunas cosas por ejemplo si no le pongo el alta voz no se escucha,Rocio,"August 25, 2021",3.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,Que no se escucha si no le pongo el alta voz
No es lo que esperaba,Jaime Lara,"August 23, 2021",2.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"Compre este tel√©fono, lastimosamente vino defectuoso y me toco mandar a reparar el bot√≥n power. Vengo de tener un huawei P30 pro, es decir, un tel√©fono con excelente c√°mara. Para mi sorpresa, a pesar de ser gama tope de samsung y tener la mejor c√°mara, tanto la interfaz como el procesamiento de imagen es inferior al huawei P30 pro con el Android 10.0. La nitidez, la reducci√≥n de ruido en tomas oscuras, la saturacion de colores, la apertura, el efecto bokeh y el modo profesional son mejores en el P30 pro. Solo la c√°mara de 108mp y el zoom digital x 100 son los puntos fuertes de la c√°mara de este tel√©fono. No digo que sea una mala compra, pero para ser gama tope de Samsung esperaba m√°s. Saludos desde El Salvador"
Great phone,Lucy,"August 18, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,Phone is a great phone takes great pictures but the battery don't last too long and it takes really long to charge but it's still worth it I like it
No tan impresionante,cesar adonis flores,"August 17, 2021",3.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"Equipo es pesado, en mi pa√≠s funciona lento en p√°ginas de internet"
The battery doesn't last long.,Horlorlardey,"August 14, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,The battery doesn't last long.
Great Purchase,Xoxo,"August 14, 2021", 4.,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,Great battery life and camera quality
Expensive but nice,David,"August 14, 2021",4.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,The C port loses connection from time to time. Very frustrating for the money.
Amazing,MBlack,"August 11, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,Boyfriend loved it. Might get one for me.
Nothing like a digital SLR...not worth it,Cassandra Englund,"August 11, 2021",3.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"I've had a digital SLR camera, and this phone supposedly took great photos with remarkable quality so I decided to buy this rather than a new SLR. I have been really disappointed with this phone's camera features. Wish I would have bought a new SLR and kept my old phone."
Great phone. Ok battery. Awsome camera.,Lar,"August 11, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,Great phone. Ok battery. Awesome camera. Spent all day in a truck during a heatwave though and took quite a while to cool down enough to not be hot to the touch. With prima day sales it was a steal of a deal compared to any of the local deals. It was quite the upgrade from tge s7 active i have had the past few years.
Zoom - good. Photo quality - sucks (worse than older models),Amazon Customer,"August 11, 2021",2.0,,,"It's nice that it has zoom lenses, but everything else about th camera seems worse. Whatever post editing Samsung is doing, sucks. Color have too much saturation and all details are lost if something has a vibrant color (such as iguanas here in Florida). In general, there's a lot of noise and blochiness in the pictures.  Not impressed. I, like so many others, find the pictures on older models to be more detailed and accurate.Also, why on earth would you get rid of sd card slots and headphone jacks. That was the primary advantage you had over apple. The moment apple has a phone with a decent zoom lenses, goodbye Samsung."
Solid phone,Lucas,"August 9, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,Very solid phone with a great prime day deal
Don't buy,Tim Bennett,"August 9, 2021",1.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"Don't buy. Nice camera, decent battery. That's about it. No quality control.  Cheaply made. No memory card. No indicator light. It's just a cheap phone. I've been a Samsung fan for years but my next phone will be an Apple."
Cmon Samsung..,Joseph Pastusek,"August 8, 2021",3.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"For a $1200 flagship one would think the batter would be great, but frankly it's complete ass. For the specs it has, it surely doesn't operate as long as it should.Maybe I got a bad battery or the phone simply isn't tweaked to perform as it should"
Value for money!,Hussain Didi,"August 7, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,Says used but the phone was brand new. Came in an open box.
Worst camera ever,Kulbir,"August 6, 2021",1.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"The camera feels like the photos are captured using a camera from 2016.Low light photos are even worse. 4 cameras and no camera can capture a good photo.I bought this phone because of Android. But seriously disappointed.If you compare the photos with iphone 12 pro, they stand out without doubt.Would suggest you to wait for Google pixel 6 pro.Don't buy s21 ultra. Worst camera on a flagship phone ever. Way to go Samsung. I'm sorry but your cameras are really really bad. Or your image processing algorithms are really really bad. Please improve. Thanks"
Reliable and easy to use!,Amazon Customer,"August 3, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,Good quality phone without the Apple price!
Unlocked phones are bloat free. The OS seems polished and things work well.,Christopher A. Boyer,"August 1, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"Getting used to the 21 ultra from the s6 edge I find things just work better. The functionality is complete with my Truck's Bluetooth.  It reads my txt to me, something the same didn't do. It downloaded my entire phone book in one shot. S6 would choke and then the rest had to be downloaded one at a time. The screen is bigger but the edge was fine in that respect. I changed phones because t-mobile sent out letters saying the old technology was being phased out by January. I had just replaced the battery in the edge for drone use and was not looking to replace it. That said the unlocked phone is great in that it doesn't have bloatwear on it. The camera impressed me, especially on a close up of a coin to see the details. My complaint is nonreplaceable battery and no micro SD card slot. Water resistance is a joke, light rain used over and over. How about toilet depth? Seems like that would be useful. The pen seems useful and they say it will one day work the camera. Hopefully that's true."
Great phone. Lightning fast,Danny K,"July 31, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,Fast. Ability to choose cell phone provide of my choice. Great camera and storage with fast processor!
A step down from the Note 20 Ultra,Donali Peter,"July 30, 2021",3.0,,,"Extremely disappointed in this phone. Without expandable storage it couldn't even receive the transfer of all that was on my Note 20 Ultra, and that was without transferring files or photos. And even though there is marginal support for an SPen, there is no on board storage for one. While a compatible blue tooth S Pen is in the works, it not yet released, which is another fail because now there is no remote function for the camera. And the camera was the main reason to get this phone, but with no expandable storage, every fabulous, HD photo/video you take steals from your internal storage which you need to run your apps, etc. I feel stupid for not thinking about these things in advance, and not realizing there was no expandable storage before I ""upgraded"". Definitely suffering from buyer's remorse. This phone has already had response issues, which I never experienced with the Note 8, Note 9 or Note 20 Ultra. Do not recommend."
Trade in,Daniel norbert luca,"July 30, 2021",1.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,They agreed on trading in my old phone note10+ in perfect shape after I told them that I got it from Tmobile.I've sent it out and they returned it. Saying that they can not take it in a phone that is locked even though I have told them from the beginning.
Amazon did right by me,Paul Camerone,"July 29, 2021",3.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,I've used Samsung exclusively since the S3 the ultra is an excellent phone and the camera is absolutely amazing. The phone I purchased had many issues the worst being a touchscreen that freeze's up as well as issues with the keyboard. Amazon took it back NQA looking forward to getting new one that works properly.
HEADLINE... customization,Weeza,"July 28, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"This is a beautiful phone, but the thing that has impressed me most is the customization that Samsung has built in this model. I've used Samsung in the past and always been disappointed by the amount of bloatware they included. This phone it is kept to a minimum and there are so many settings to really customize to my individual wants. I've been using pixels and I love the operating system and being able to customize more than any Apple phone but the quality of the camera and the screen is so much better on this Samsung."
Great Phone,Carole Huschle,"July 27, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,Love my phone!!
Great device! I'm very pleased.,Empress Itrina,"July 27, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,The phone meets and surpasses all my expectations
Best phone üì± made to date üìÖ.,Michael,"July 26, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,I bought this for my girlfriend. She is so very happy. Yeah it cost more then most phone's. But completely worth it. Now if I could get her off her phone long enough to go to dinner. Lol worth every dime spent. Awesome quality! Oh and Beautiful pictures. You can do just about anything with this phone. To bad it doesn't do the dishes. Lol but it does everything else.
S21 Ultra. It's Amazing,Adarsh Tandon,"July 23, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,Great phone. Have been using for a month now bit it's a great durable phone and awesome camera with great build over all.  Battery is good for a day
"Have to return, battery does not hold charge",cifr,"July 22, 2021",1.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"Looks cool, many camera lens, but the battery does not hold a charge."
Amazing phone but buy a super fast charger,Wes Techie,"July 21, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"Moved to the 21 ultra from an unlocked S10.  The battery and camera on this device are outstanding. Added the OtterBox commuter case, AM film tempered glass screen protector and the 65 watt Anker super fast charger. It is disappointing a charger couldn't be included for such a high level device thats capable of super fast charging. Sure I have several old charging plugs laying around but none capable of putting out wattage for the super fast charge. Bought the Anker 65 watt charger and works fine just another added expense. There is not headphone jack or as card storage expansion but so far have not missed them since I have some wireless earbuds and large enough storage on the phone for what I do."
Good phone,pradeep datla,"July 20, 2021",4.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,High quality phone with lot of software issues. Mainly bought it for photos but the quality is not on par with iphone
Beat phone I ever had,Justice Harris,"July 16, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,Phone is fire
Cut through the drama,Sassy chassis,"July 15, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"I had been shopping this phone make and model for a while. My husband is a pro photographer and was reluctant to give up his precious Samsung 6 because of its superior camera, however it was outdated in the battery life department. Lets face it renting a phone and then either purchasing it or being told basically it isnt anything as a trade to the next one that you will also be renting is just another contract that ties up your options and money.  An opportunity I couldnt resist happened when the target phone came up as a lightning deal while i was Prime day shopping.  It was flawlessly activated today. No hiccups.So so happy. And we have no strings or drama about flex lease or billing.  The price point still cant be matched anywhere else. Win win"
Thought battery would last longer then 1 day of use,Grimreaper,"July 15, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom BlackSize: 128GBStyle: S21 Ultra,Verified Purchase,"I don't use it a lot but it still takes the battery to 15% in a 24 hour period. I even slow charge it at 15w takes over 4 hours, still last just 24 hours. Love the camera, love everything about it. i came from  Pixel 2 XL so a lot of changes."
