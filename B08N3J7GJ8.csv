Would return if I could,Jason Isbell,"December 7, 2021",1.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"Constant problems.  Sim card not recognized, touch screen problems, wifi connection issues.  Samsung customer service is garbage."
No charging block,Dave A.,"November 12, 2021",Top,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"C'mon Samsung. A high priced phone, and you cheap-out on a simple charging block? This phone is just a slight improvement from its predecessor, but still a decent phone if you're looking for a replacement. This phone ONLY comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable (for wired data transfers and charging), but who has a USB-C charging block handy (at this point in time anyway)? I could almost understand a USB-C to USB-A, since most everything available for charging is USB-A, meaning you can't use your previous phone's charger, unless it too was a USB-C, so you'll need to order up some USB-C to USB-A, for home, vehicles, etc.Overall, the phone itself has not had any negative issues, and swapping over the SIM card was an easy transfer of the cell service. The wireless data transfer was also pretty good, but it didn't get everything, so carefully check to make sure everything works before discarding your old phone. You'll have to download some APPs again, but contacts and photos moved over very well. I think these phones are way over-priced when they're obsolete after just a few months."
Camera stopped working after 5 months,Fernando @ Happy Code Club,"November 5, 2021",2.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,The camera stopped working after a few months of use. It became blurry and fuzzy and useless
I just got it set  up yesterday but so far I am very happy with this phone.,Amazon Customer,"October 24, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,Very nice phone
Camera is about the only good feature,Christian Hess,"October 15, 2021",3.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,Battery life is 1 day changed to no port for headphones so now an adapter must be bought to plug into charging port for music listening or be forced to buy uncomfortable internal ear buds Had an S10 before this one it’s better save your money
Waste of time,Bear Left,"October 13, 2021",1.0,,,"Worst phone I've ever had, including my old flip-phones.  I can't turn off all the iPhone-emulating ""Bixby"" crap and can't use Skype reliably.  If you want a phone that emulates an iPhone, get an iPhone.  That is what I am about to do, after dropping $900 on this POS just two months ago."
Great phone.,Border Traveller,"October 12, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,Love this phone. We do not use the face recognition or the fingerprint reader. Waste of time but this is an excellent phone has great features. Battery and camera are great.
Tis product is sub-par,NYC Girl,"October 12, 2021",2.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,The headphone/ear bus plug connection failed after 2 weeks - so no ear bud use. The operating system doesn't support visual voice mail. The system hiccups. Total disappointment. Buy an I phone instead.
Bixby is listening,SMBmadison,"October 8, 2021",3.0,,,"This phone randomly started listening to me and I couldn't figure out why. I had already gone through the 12 step program to disable ""hey google"" from both normal use modes and google maps, and it randomly started listening to me again a few weeks later. Apparently it was Bixby this time, and no, I was not using the word ""Bixby"" ever, nor had I gone in to enable it. It was just conveniently mishearing something else as ""bixby"" and started listening. So yeah, creepy, stop making phones listen to people without their consent, it should be opt-in only.Samsung won't let me leave a review on their website but had to put it out there somewhere."
Phone has many glitches and Amazon refuses to replace!!,Annette White,"October 3, 2021",3.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,Doesn't find sim card all the time. Phone is hot to touch. While texting it flickers and jumps off screen.  I really wanted to love this phone but it has so many issues I may return...battery drains very fast too....took to samsung technician and phone deemed unfixable! I don't want refund I want replacement!!! I can't send back this phone until I have new phone to transfer data!!!! Amazon refuses to replace!!! Don't believe what they say!! Do not buy their phones. Very bad business!
Samsung S21 5G,Cheyenne,"September 20, 2021",5.0,,,"Purchase this phone to a different site but I have the same exact phone and I used straight talk. To those people saying it isn't dual sim, IT IS DUAL SIM. The tray has space for one nano SIM card on the top, and another on the underside. Go check it out! 😉"
"Great phone, decent price, great camera. Happy with my decision to buy s21",AK,"September 9, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"Great phone. Photos are awesome much better than my previous pixel 3a phone. Can't go wrong if you are looking to make a quick decision. Price is reasonable, I don't like to pay a lot for a phone but would like something that has a decent camera."
Bad product from samsung,Sreekumar N.,"September 7, 2021",1.0,,,"No SD card function and no regular headphones jack, have to buy another cable to listen audio. Comes without charger. I am using samsung from last 12 years.  Never expected from them this kind of bad phone"
Love,America Sianez,"September 5, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"I dislike the finger print reader,  its glitchy but other than that it's a really nice phone. It's pretty ( phantom purple!!) and has a ton of great features, which I'm still discovering."
Worst Galaxy Phone EVER,L. Sysel,"September 5, 2021",2.0,,,"My husband and I have had Galaxy phones for years (I think the first one I had was the S3 and I have owned a few Galaxy tablets).  We had to upgrade in February because there was an app he needed that the S8+ couldn't download.We have regretted it every day!When searching on Google or trying to access a website it gets hung up and we have to restart the search, it doesn't matter if we're out and about or connected to our home Wi-Fi. The in-call sound quality is frequently spotty, and often terrible.  Many times when I try to send a text it fails and I have to resend it.  We have the same phone company and plan, so it isn't due to that.The app he needed doesn't  work properly on this one, but would on the S21 +, the tech that sold us the phone knew what app he needed but sold us this phone anyway.The keypad seems different, and not in a good way.We would not recommend this particular Galaxy phone at all, I hope the next one is better!!"
Nice phone!,Ms. Berry,"September 5, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"Happy I got this phone. Like the bright colors, fingerprint reader, and camera. On a video call my friend immediately mentioned my picture was much better on my new phone. I still have to learn some features but so far I am really happy I bought this phone!"
"No eSIM, no microSD slot - no sale!",ScottS,"August 25, 2021",3.0,,,"Sorry Samsung - I will not upgrade from my S20+ until you enable the eSIM capability that is built in to each and every S21, but turned off.  Also, they eliminated the SD slot!  Hello!?"
Excelente!,Amazon Customer,"August 24, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,Buen equipo. Recomendado
Feeling let down,John Oberley,"August 24, 2021",3.0,,,"I regret getting this phone even though it was a ""free"" upgrade. First chance I get, I'm going back to the Pixel."

Terrible Android Option,David,"August 17, 2021",2.0,,,"Worst Android phone I've ever owned. Lots of unwanted Samsung bloatware, poor Bluetooth reliability, and roughly daily crashes/reboots."
Perfect,Nikola Tiganj,"August 17, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,Amazing phone and a good seller
Honestly so not impressed,Nicole,"August 17, 2021",3.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"I've had this phone for about a month and I'm honestly only impressed with the camera. The charging port has already broken, and I had to buy a wireless charger to charge my phone. Super inconvenient."
Zippy fast little phone,Jaime steward,"August 15, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,Wish the battery lasted longer than a day. Like the wireless charging. Don't usually buy used phones but in this case felt brand new. Like that it was not locked to one cell provider
Great specs and well worth it!!,SBH,"August 13, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,One of Samsungs best by far and love the battery life!! Extremely happy with this purchase!!
Is 5G Really Faster?,Lisa,"August 11, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"I liked front sided biometrics sensor for sure , as the Galaxy 8 had it on back and so Annoying."
Great Phone,David Williams,"August 10, 2021",4.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,The S21 is a good phone and has a great camera.  I stream Baseball games and the video is very good.
Great phone!!!,pamela hand,"August 8, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,Fast delivery exactly as pictured had charging cord with it.  Great buy!  Brand new phone.
Works well,Angel,"August 8, 2021",4.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"I bought this phone ""used very good"" and there were no visible scratches. I did have some difficulty with updating apps like google chrome and needed the assistance of the internet to do so.  Also the wifi connection is about the same as my S9.  I would say the S7 tablet has better connection.  Other than that, great phone so far.  I must say as well that the violet color looks soo pretty in person."
The network blocks 🚫  fr ok m time to time! 🙁,Yazmin Tirado,"August 7, 2021",2.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,I have to reset the network from time to time because it blocks 🚫  my network. Very  bad when I'm alone because without internet and signal to call I would be stranded.
UI is terrible,Amazon Customer,"August 4, 2021",2.0,,,"I recently ""upgraded"" from a Pixel 4 and I wish I had just stayed with google phones. The UI is one of the worst, most buggy things ever created by a phone manufaturer. Apps are constantly closing or stop working, alarms (even after adjusting all the settings) do not work often, and my god trying to close open apps is a pain. I almost never review anything, but this phone annoys me enough to where I had to."
"Good smartphone,  but the battery life is very disappointing",Yitzhak B.,"August 3, 2021",3.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"One of thebest smartphones of 2021 , i like the One Ui with all Samsung features  , i also like the shape and the camera quality  , but i think they can invest more in the Battery capacity,  i can use the device full day without charging , i also think that the camera software it's not smooth enough, and there's some stucks and bugs."
1st brand new phone in a very long time I am very satisfied with it,Casper Stevens,"August 2, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,I like the size of it I like the color and the camera I like the fact that it has a lot of extra things and accessories that I never had on my old government phone I do have to say the prices of these new phones are Way over price I do have an issue with my reception
Love my new phone!,Blanca,"August 1, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,Got this during Prime Day and holy cannoli what a great deal!!! I have never seen the S21 that cheap ever and you still get the same great phone! The camera is awesome with great pro options. The wide lens is gorgeous and makes my photos look so much more professional. The 120 Hz refresh rate is so... refreshing and just makes scrolling so much smoother. It doesn't drain the battery life as much as I thought it would so I keep it on all the time. I upgraded from my beloved S8 and I'm so glad I did! 😌
5G,SMWillingham,"August 1, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,Tells you when 5G is availableSeems really fastOutstanding picturesMany untried features
Issues with cellphone,Amazon Customer,"July 31, 2021",2.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,The cellphone continues to shut off or restart on its own repeatedly through out the day. Today alone it shut off six times.
The phone didn't switch off. When I switched iton.,Henry Osunmadewa,"July 30, 2021",1.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,iron. Phone can't switch of.
Great phone,Aili Lightfoot,"July 29, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,Great phone. It came when it says it was going to and came undamaged. I've always stuck with Samsung phones. It is fast and works as expected.
"Es buen celular,  pero la batería dura poco",hernandez adriana,"July 28, 2021",4.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"Me gustó mucho el funcionamiento del celular,  la cámara es genial de noche. Pero la batería dura poco y eso que casi no lo uso. No tiene entrada de auxiliar, por lo que se tiene que usar por fuerza audífonos Bluetooth."
Love the phone,maxine dunn,"July 28, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,Got a good deal through Amazon. Good picture quality.good size. Fast. Moved up from the note9.
"Weak battery, good phone",Konkero,"July 28, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,Needs to be charged every 8 hours basically
Overheating,Justin,"July 27, 2021",2.0,,,"I bought this phone on prime day and was super excited. The phone was nice and all but for whatever reason my phone would get super hot. I couldn't understand why. I looked up multiple sources and it seems that many people have this issue. So, if you are planning to buy this phone don't"
Like it,Jae Chon,"July 27, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,Amazon deal day!!! 200 cheaper!!! Got it on good day with good price!!
LOVE IT !!!!,Brandy Sullenger,"July 26, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,Love this phone.  Still trying to figure it out...
Not a bad phone... but,RWP,"July 26, 2021",3.0,,,"Pretty fast phone, seems well made but what is up with all the bloatware?I like Android, it works for me and I am used to it.But when a manufacturer makes their own software and makes it so it cannot be removed that sends up red flags for me. I have spent hours disabling and locking down apps on this phone and even when I do they still come up.If I wanted to use samsungs apps I would use them.If I don't want to use them I should be able to remove them.But no they are locked to the phone. I makes me worry that they could be a security problem and they they could be doing something that I don't know about.Or maybe samsung it just so smart that they make better apps?Do I need an animated clock icon over the stock Android clock?Might be an OK phone but I don't like all the forced software."
Don't do it,CeeTheShopper,"July 26, 2021",1.0,,,Definitely not worth it
great difficulty would allow fingers to register on phone i e could only use phone with stylus,Heather,"July 26, 2021",1.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"Phone had great difficulty accepting finger commands as the phone would not accept your finger tap. Swollen hands. Can I only use with stylus! Glitches: set and then it would unset itself ex clock, put weather on. Unusable re fingers. Microphone-60 seconds and then it would shut off which is untenable for a handicapped person trying to dictate an email for example."
A+,Patrick Chung,"July 25, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,Great phone. I bought it during Prime day and received it a day earlier than promised. The colors are great and the phone has had no problems whatsoever. Thank you for a quality product!
I love it,Michelle,"July 25, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,I love it
Awesome speed and battery life,pd,"July 24, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"Compared to my Pixel, Samsung S21 5G exceeded in terms of speed, performance and battery.  I'm able to go nearly 2 full days without recharging.  Apps open up pretty quick. Outlook used to be extremely slow in pixel but  loads and performs well in Samsung.  Photo quality is great but pixel was much better in auto-focus particularly in situations where we have significant light gradient such as shade and sunlight.One aspect I didn't like is lots of unnecessary Samsung apps.  Also I wish the phone was slightly wider."
Disappointing battery life,Sissybug57,"July 23, 2021",3.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,Love everything about the phone except the battery life. A charge doesn't even last my usual 12-14 hour day.
Worth it. Quality phone,monique alexander,"July 22, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"I really like this phone. I upgraded from an S8+. The camera quality is outstanding. The phone is a beautiful lavender color. I heard the battery life was bad but I have had no problems it lasts all day through numerous phone calls, texts, zooms and tik toks lol. The only downside I have found so far is the finger print and face scanner I does not recognize me about half of the time which is a little annoying."
Love my new phone,Judith M Jeanotte,"July 22, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"I'm so glad I finally broke down and bought a new phone. My granddaughter did the research and recommended the s21. I hated my old lg v20. The s21 holds a charge so much longer, the pictures are exquisite I even got some clear shots of otters in the river. I'm not too technologically savvy but so far the ease of use is simple. Definitely recommend."
Good upgrade for me,Notoriously Clever,"July 20, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"I am thoroughly enjoying my first month of using this phone, which is why I did not rate the battery life. I'm a pretty heavy user, although not for games.-The Bluetooth pairs great with my Echo Buds for workouts at the gym.-Photos are a breeze, nice and crisp.-Phone audio volume is good, much better than my previous phone (LG Q7+, 3 yrs. old)-Size is a little bigger than I might like for my hands, but not when I am trying to read pdfs or watch videos.-Overall, recommend highly (except for customers who are always disappointed with the world)I'm very happy with it."
Came without a usable charger?!?,JSellers,"July 15, 2021",4.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"The phone itself is great so far. Came in perfect new condition. Set up was a breeze. I just don't understand why a phone wouldn't come witha complete charger, or a cord that can be plugged into a charging block. Now I have to buy a whole charger. Annoyed and disappointed ."
only works in metro area.,Ellen Garity,"July 15, 2021",4.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,Does not work in suburbs only downtown. Sent back on the 10th It was delivered on the 14th at 2:30pm. Still no refund on the 15th. Usually get refund as soon as UPS has it.
Garbage phone disgusting,Baligh H.,"July 14, 2021",1.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,Came with no charger no cable poorly packed. Phone gets so hot almost instantly.it is not working no more second day
Not a good investment,Kindle Customer,"July 12, 2021",1.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"The fingerprint reader hardly ever works; the face reader occasionally works.  The worst part is the phone just decides to power off at different times.  This was a terrible purchase and apparently since it's over the 30 days since I bought it, there's nothing I can do to get my money back.  I will never purchase a phone this way again."
Great product,Michael Darkwa,"July 11, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,Great product and looks really new even though it is used. I recommend this seller to everyone.
Dont buy,Ulyana Malovana,"July 10, 2021",1.0,,,"I have an awful s21 + phone, it heats up, it burns in my hand, it's buggy, it slows down, the 120 screen doesn't always turn on, the sensor sometimes doesn't respond, I'm sorry I changed my s10 + for this garbage, you know, this is my latest Samsung phone  go to the iPhone, goodbye"
You must be close to your wifi to enjoy this phone.,Code Red,"July 10, 2021",1.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"The phone seems to be a very good phone. I love the look. I love the design. Until I brought it out in the garage. At first, I thought that we're only having problem with our internet service provider because I'm having trouble browsing the internet, but when I went inside the house, all of a sudden I was able to browse the internet. So, I went out in the garage again. To my surprise, I'm having trouble browsing the internet again. That's when I decided to use my Samsung S8+, the phone I was going to replace with this. My S8+ had no trouble browsing the internet or using an app, but the S21, it did. So, I decided to do some tests using the internet speed test. That's when I realized my S8+ was significantly faster than S21 using home wifi. So, I decided to get inside the car in the driveway where I had no problem using the S8+. The S21 could not even finish the internet speed test because it's too slow and had a hard time connecting. The S21 I got has a problem with connection speed. The farther you are from the source of wifi, the harder it is to connect to the internet. My Samsung S8+ and Note 4 did not have this trouble. I bought my wife the S20 FE and I'm so jealoused. I should have bought the S20 FE for myself as well."
Product was damaged,Amazon Customer,"July 9, 2021",2.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"The phone came broken. The package was OK, I'm doubting it was a new item."
NO SD CARD SLOT. USELESS PHONE,Jake Socks,"July 6, 2021",1.0,,,"NO SD CARD SLOT?? WHAT IS THIS 2001? ONLY REASON ANDROID HAS EVEN COMPETED WITH APPLE WAS KEEPING A 3.5, SD CARD AND REMOVABLE BATTERY.. THEY ARE REMOVING ALL THESE FEATURES 1 BY 1 SAMSUNG HAS BECOME APPLE AND THEY ARE JUNK !!!!!!!!!oh and my battery last as long as my 2 year old galaxy a20. had the phone for a single day and left work with less battery then i had in the past on my 2 year old phone. samsung needs to recall this garbage increase the battery and give us OUR OWN MEMORY CARD SUPPORT"
Love this phone and super good quality.,Customer,"July 4, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"Such a great phone, I love it. Good camera and also cute af. I love how it doesn't have the ""edge"" like samsungs other phones and it's just a regular screen."
Don't do it to yourself,Michael Murphy,"July 2, 2021",1.0,,,"Bought a Samsung S21 on January. 6 months later the SIM Card is not responding, and I lost access to use my data, calls, and texts. This happened a week ago. I Go to Verizon Store on the next day and get two separate SIM Cards put in and they tell me the reader is broken but I can try Best Buy (Where I purchased it) and they maybe can help. They called Samsung support with me and they told us to switch out the SIM Card (didn't work) and then told us to do a factory reset. Did that and it didn't work so they told us to take the Phone to UBreakiFix (Samsung affiliated phone repair in my area). For the S21 they can repair the SIM reader and Samsung requires they try that first. Work order went in Sunday, Part Came in Thursday. UBreakiFix was great got it replaced same day it came in and it did not work. Samsung made them run tests that take over 2 hours so they can verify that it is eligible for in store trade in for the new phone. They did and it has been in pre approval since yesterday. It is now Friday, one week AFTER the phone stopped working. Up until this point i understand Samsung having me jump through some hoops before they send me a new phone.I called UBreakiFix today and they say Samsung has not approved the replacement or the instore pick up. I get my Job ID # and call Samsung. I explain how inconvenient this process has been and the 1st two techs hung up on me after asking me to hold to view documentation. I know this because i was on hold and after a while it asked me to give the Support Tech rating, which happens after the call. I called a 3rd time and got a great tech called Rene (he was amazing) and he didn't even hang up on me. He told me that he did not have the authorization to expedite (fair) this situation and was honest that it's optimistically going to take at least 6-9 more days but probably more. I asked him to hook me up with a supervisor and they will call me back as soon as they’re free.So the timeline is this:Sat - Phone breaks - no data, no phone calls, no textSun - Spend my afternoon going to Verizon, Bestbuy, and the Samsung Affiliate UbreakiFix and my work order is put in and part ordered - no data, no phone calls, no textMon - no data, no phone calls, no textTue - no data, no phone calls, no textWed - no data, no phone calls, no textThur - They get the sim card reader, switch it out, do a factory reset, and none of that works. Request for an In store replacement - no data, no phone calls, no textFri - Still not approved for the replacement. Call Samsung support to see if I can get the approval expedited and the first two support techs hang up on me. Third tech tells me that optimistically it will take another 6-9 days.At the end of the day, Samsung's flagship S21 broke 6 months after me purchasing. I jumped through every hoop for the last week just to have two techs hang up on me when i call Samsung Support. I have gone 7 days and optimistically will have to go another 6-9 more (13-17 days total) without data, phone calls, or texts. I will also have to continue to pay for my Verizon data plan that i won't be able to use at all. In a day and age where cell phones are so massively used this process is unacceptable and any new phone moving forward will NOT be a Samsung.After all that negative I want to highlight how amazing Rene, their support tech, was and how great UBreakiFix was. They were the only positives in this whole ordeal."

"Good phone, camera. But charge doesn't last long",Sasha,"July 1, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"Really like this phone. Great camera, too. Only negative is the short time a charge lasts. That was, however, listed in the specs."
Lots of storage,Willow,"June 28, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"I use this phone for personal use and it is just great! the battery life is a bit short but I have a few battery backups lying around so it doesn't matter too much, and the color I picked was just so beautiful"

Samsung Galaxy S21 5G,Leslie,"June 25, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"I've had this phone for a couple months now.. No problems with it at all. Was very easy to set it up. Camera works great. It comes with a ""C"" cord but no adapter to plug in wall. You need to purchase a ""C"" Adapter."
Not bad,Aaron Greenberg,"June 21, 2021",2.0,,,"To begin with my recent conclusion: this will be my last Android device. The reason being that Android devices have weaker security and are not made with consumers’ privacy in mind. The evidence for weak security is that a zero-day for Android is sold for much less than a zero-day for iOS. Evidence for weak security and/or a lack of privacy is that the DOJ has reported difficulty in unlocking confiscated iOS devices and butted heads with Apple over the issue of a backdoor – this has not occurred between the DOJ and Google, which implies something. The preceding is nothing new, but the impetus for my (future) move to Apple is their coming App Tracking Transparency feature. I doubt that Google, a company that makes most of its money through ad revenue, will follow suit.Security and privacy concerns aside, the S21 is a decent phone. I had read horror stories about Samsung’s trade-in program, but I had no trouble. Taking the trade-in into consideration, I feel like the S21 is a pretty good value – but that would not be the case at full MSRP.Pros:• The screen resolution is no better than my old S7, but the 120 Hz is lovely.• The screen isn’t curved!• The camera doesn’t compete with my friend’s iPhone 12 Pro, but it’s pretty good so far.• The processor is quick and handles multiple applications.Cons:• The SD card slot and headphone jack have been removed (if not for the trade-in offer, I would have purchased an S20).• Bloatware that I cannot uninstall, such as Netflix and Samsung Health. Every unused program is nothing more than wasted space and a security risk.• The plastic backing feels cheap and flimsy.• The Swype function doesn’t work as well as on my old S7 and the reception seems to be worse.• Why am I getting ads in my notification bar? Am I the consumer or the product?Bugs/Unknowns:• It seems like the phone was constantly alternating between 5G and LTE, possibly inefficiently. Now I have 5G disabled."

Power Features,Karen W,"June 3, 2021",4.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"My device arrived in perfect new condition. Set up was easy, and I found getting everything organized natural. I decided to write a review to give some important things to know from the power users point of view. I have used the device for about 1 week now.First, some background. I work on consumer electronics professionally. This means I'm absolutely a power user. Other reviewers cover the basics better, so I'm going to focus on those details that power users would really want to know but have a hard time finding before buying.I'll start with the bad. Samsung completely dropped the ball on two important features: visual voicemail and RCS messaging.The former only works if you have a carrier app that supports it. The built-in dialer has no support for visual voicemail whatsoever, and if you install the Google dialer, Samsung's modifications prevent it from accessing visual voicemail services on my carrier. If you care about visual voicemail, and your carrier doesn't provide a carrier specific app, then you're out of luck. In my opinion, this is the biggest downside of the phone: Samsung software. If I knew that visual voicemail wasn't officially supported without a carrier application, I wouldn't have bought this phone. I'm on Mint Mobile where no carrier application is available, meaning I just don't have this feature on a premium flagship phone. That's a fail. I expect this feature standard in the premium segment.For RCS messaging, support in their SMS app is strangely absent for this latest model phone. Even if you install Google Messages and Carrier Services, it activates, but I was never able to successfully send an RCS message.As a power user, I like running the latest Android software. Samsung is getting better about this, but the updates will lag Pixel phones. Samsung is on the right track offering 3 years of software support followed by an additional fourth year of security updates.If you like Android tunables, this is the phone for you. You can control everything from high-speed battery charging levels vs cycle count to detailed power savings restrictions applied to each app. You can control the kind of network you connect to using what technology, and you can even view networks in your area from other carriers that aren't yours! I really like having this degree of control over the phone. It almost makes up for the lack of visual voicemail.Snapdragon 888 performance is the best at any price for Android. Although it doesn't challenge the king of mobile silicon performance, Apple, performance remains excellent with the new X1 prime core. This phone can play anything beautifully and will not leave you wanting more.Reverse wireless charging and the ability to output to a full size display over HDMI are as niche as they are wonderfully geeky. I love the idea that I could use this phone as my only computer.The indisplay fingerprint reader is fast and responsive. I have applied a glass display protector, and it still works if you recalibrate your fingerprints and increase display sensitivity. It's just not as responsive. I'm of the opinion that the back of the device is the best place to put a fingerprint reader or on the power button. With that said, the solution works.Battery life is genuinely all day. It's definitely not two day battery life, but I end the day using my phone actively for much of it with some power to spare. The battery size for this phone is just right.Camera is spectacular. It's better than my own eyes. I'll leave this one to the photographers. I love the AI powered scene recognition; it's helped me take some unbelievable shots.Overall: a premium device with strange omissions and cool niche features. I like the phone, but I question the manufacturer's priorities at times. You shouldn't have to compromise at this price. With that said, this is pretty cool phone that will please many users."
"Mostly good, but make sure to buy the adapter block for charger.",Branden,"May 22, 2021",3.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"So far the phone seems great for the most part. The camera is amazing, the phone is quick, but the battery life isn't super great. Another really frustrating thing is it came with a charging cord bit no adapter block to plug it in! And the cord isn't a USB type, it has the type c on both ends so you can't use the old adapter block to plug it in, so I don't know how they expected us to charge the dang thing. I had to run out to the store to buy an adapter to charge it."
great phone,Kristina Jones,"May 21, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,great phone
No adopter,Asha manning,"May 19, 2021",4.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,How do you expect us to charge the phone of we dont get a adopter of the cable card it doesn't makes sense..
"Cheaper than in stores, Great Unlocked phone.",1flymom,"May 14, 2021",4.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this because it was about 300.00 less than the stores and the Samsung site. Recieved mine yesterday. I'm think I am having problems with people hearing me on speaker at times but that could be user error. Still trying to figure that out. Plus my calls aren't ringing thru,I just see a pop up. Again could be a user issue. Its truly unlocked, many camera options.  Note, no outer jacks to plugged head phones truly bluetooth. Works for me though. I absolutely love the back of the phone, its not slippery or metallic like. It has some friction so it doesn't just slide out your hand. Love the floating home screen and the flashlight is quite bright. As usual Samsung rocks.  Fingerprint reader, add at least two, one holding in your hand and one on your lap or desk.. The pressure points are different and could throw it off and it won't work.  My experience anyway. I will keep trying my phone out and update my post if needed but so far so good. I have the purple cell and its much prettier than the pics."
No Expandable Storage (sd card) - Previous S Models are Better Overall,A.V.,"May 10, 2021",1.0,,,"Disappointing phone, previous galaxy S models were better.- Surprisingly, compared to the S20, the S21 is a downgrade- It has NO EXPANDABLE STORAGE (microSD slot) as previous models have had, including the S20. This is a big deal for anyone who uses a lot of storage and does not want to be forced to use cloud storage- Although the S21's processor is faster than the S20's processor, it is not a big enough improvement to buy the S21 as opposed to the S20- The camera on the S21 is not better than the S20 (at least not better enough to notice). For some camera uses, even older models produce the same results- I ordered this phone with Prime, shipped and sold by Amazon. Although the phone was in stock and supposed to arrive in 2 days, Amazon only shipped it on the 4th day after the order was made. Beware, if you want to receive it in a short period of timeOverall, I feel the S20 (S20+ or Ultra) or even the new iPhone ordered through a different retailer are better options if you want a new phone in 2021."

Works perfectly,Damien V.,"April 21, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"Got the item a few days early, pleasant seller, 10/10 would buy from again"
"Sent back, no IMEI. WTF!",Hallbe,"April 20, 2021",3.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"Well, the phone seemed nice, but I couldn’t use it for anything because it had no IMEI number on it. It had one on the box, but nothing installed on the phone. So I couldn’t update it, use it with my carrier, or anything basically. Not sure what is going on with that. I spent 45 minutes on the phone with Samsung who couldn’t figure it out either. So, it’s going to be returned!"
Better than Apple,Honest Reviews,"April 17, 2021",5.0,,,Way better than iPhone
Great phone but needed sd card slot,R. Ricsin,"April 16, 2021",5.0,,,"I thought to write a review because samsung did me well on their site, with trade in and the rewards.The phone is quick and Samsung polished the new ui pretty well since my s8.But the only gripe is not having an sd card slot and no way to unlock bootloader and use alternate operating systems, but these days most people think we have a choice between google and apple lol.So yeah, good product but the market itself is turning more propietary."
Basically amazing,Kami,"April 12, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"I LOVE this phone! Seriously such an improvement from my old one. Everything works as designed and when it doesn't, it's definitely user error (fingerprint reader). The battery normally lasts me all day but there have been times I've had to charge once during heavy use. Generally, it charges within an hour and life is good again. I'm just getting to know the personalized battery adjustments, but it seems awesome so far! Best thing though is I didn't have to spend an absurd amount of money. Oh, and the color is my favorite 😍"
Not the right country,Jalen Rantschler,"April 7, 2021",1.0,,,"The product I bought was for international cell phone towers, not US towers."
Wouldn't waste the money,Kate Mumma,"March 23, 2021",3.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"Battery life is short if you use any of the apps. Most of my apps (email, Amazon, etc.) continuously crash and do not work. Overall, not thrilled with the quality for the money."
Great,Acsanrod,"March 19, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,It was a gift for may mom and she's been loving it since we gave it to her. Absolutely loves the camera quality and sound
Great phone,N. Woeltje,"March 9, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,"Love my new phone. Did not activate fingerprint reader. I figure if something  happens  to me, my husband  won't have access to my information  I keep  on my phone.  I don't have anything  to hide from him."
Samsung done it again,Louis Wright,"March 8, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,Very smooth phone. Camera is great and the screen is very pleasing on the eye. Perfect size for me with a thin case. Easy to handle yet big enough to enjoy watching everything on it.
"It has a plastic back, this is unacceptable build quality for a flagship phone.",Wolffe,"February 28, 2021",1.0,,,"Even many budget phones over the past few years have embraced a metal frame, glass sandwich design. Samsung has decided to take a huge step backwards this year by making the back of the S21 plastic. I just don't understand, this is terrible.What makes it worse is that US model Samsung smartphones are stuck with a locked bootloader. This means you have to use Samsung's slow, bloatware and ad-filled version of Android. You can't root the phone or flash custom ROMs. It's disgustingly anti-consumer behavior."
A Must Buy!,N'Tajavas Williams,"February 22, 2021",5.0,Color: Phantom VioletSize: 128GBStyle: S21,Verified Purchase,I Love This Phone but the only problem I got is the Battery Life🔋. I really think you should buy it still. Don't let my review keep you from getting the amazing phone!
DONT BUY,ismael a.,"February 20, 2021",1.0,,,Bought this phone activated it and it lasted 20 minutes before the battery drain to 0% it was literally extremely hot that I had to put a hard case to save my skin from burning and you can smell the case burnt rubber.i sent back same day what a trash.3 days still didn't get refunded
